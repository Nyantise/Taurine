# Taurine

This is a template for Tauri + React + TS that i've been creating, testing and prototyping, most of these features are coming from a side project.
you can help me with features, better code practices and architecture (if possible i would like explanations why your approach is a better one)

it comes with some pre-configured things, like i18n with autocompletion.

- maximize, minimize, unmaximizing window events and custom window animations. (Tauri dont come with most of these)

- multi window store sync, store persistance.

! actualy tested only on linux !

! work in progression, i don't recommended to use for anything yet !

Planning to add:

- (maybe) shadcn (for faster prototyping)
- Overlay
- Custom tray window
